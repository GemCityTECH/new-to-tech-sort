# New To Tech Sorting

A sample repository to support New To Tech sessions exploring Big O notation and sort performance for [Gem City Tech](https://gemcity.tech/).

See the backing presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YK062T2LeC0yG-A4uv6mf3Fny2IouFT-Z6secfSaMNk/edit?usp=sharing).

## How to run

### Prerequisites

You must have Python 3.12 and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) installed.

### Execution

Ensuring that you have Poetry available in your terminal, run

```bash
poetry shell
```

to use Poetry's virtual environment, and then

```bash
poetry install
```

to install any dependencies. Then, either run main.py:

```bash
python main.py
```

or open a Python REPL, import functions from `bigo.py` and `generators.py`, and have fun!
